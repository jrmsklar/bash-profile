bash-profile
============

Sample `.bash_profile` configuration files that I've found and modified to my liking. Contain some useful code for modifying your command prompt as well as nice aliases.

I personally use `bash_profile_3`.

## Usage

In order to configure your bash profile to one of the profiles below, create a folder in your home (`~`) directory called `.bash_profiles` and add the `git-prompt.sh` file. Add as many profiles to this directory as you like, and copy the code from whichever one you wish to use as your default bash profile to your `.bash_profile` file.

Command for this: 

`cp ~/.bash_profiles/bash_profile_<profile number>.sh ~/.bash_profile`
