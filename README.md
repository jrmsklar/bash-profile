bash-profile
============

Sample `.bash_profile` configuration files that I've found and modified to my liking. Contain some useful code for modifying your command prompt as well as nice aliases. (Don't mind the strange numbering)

## Usage

In order to configure your bash profile to your one of the profiles here, create a folder in your home (`~`) directory called `.bash_profiles` and add the `git-prompt.sh` file. Add as many profiles in this directory as you want, and copy the code from whichever one you wish to use as your default bash profile to your `.bash_profile` file.

Command for this: 
`cp ~/.bash_profiles/bash_profile_?.sh ~/.bash_profile`
